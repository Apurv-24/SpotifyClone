# 📚 My Online Bookstore

A sleek, responsive frontend application for an online bookstore built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It allows users to browse a curated collection of books, add them to a cart, and view a live cart summary—all in a single-page experience.

## 🚀 Features

- 🖼️ Dynamic book listings with cover images
- 🛒 Interactive shopping cart with add/remove functionality
- 📱 Responsive layout optimized for mobile and desktop
- 💸 Real-time total cost calculation
- 🎨 Clean and modern UI design using custom CSS

## 🧩 Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – for semantic structure  
- **CSS3** – for responsive and stylish design  
- **Vanilla JavaScript** – for DOM manipulation and cart logic

## 📂 Project Structure

```bash
📦 Online-Bookstore
├── index.html       # Main HTML file
├── style.css        # Styling and layout
└── app.js           # Core JavaScript logic
```
#🧠 How It Works
Book data is stored in a JS array and rendered on the page dynamically.

Clicking "Add to Cart" adds the selected book to a cart array and updates the cart UI.

The cart can be opened/closed from the sidebar, and items can be removed individually.

Prices are formatted in INR (₹) and totals update in real time.
